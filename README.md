# BsplinePath

**Find shortest smooth path.**

This project finds the shortest path among the obstacles for an autonomous movement. For example, since an autonomous needs continuous speed and acceleration, it needs to move in a continuous derivative path of order 2 and 3 (C2, C3). Therefore, this program combines the Quadtree algorithm with the B-spline curve algorithm.
